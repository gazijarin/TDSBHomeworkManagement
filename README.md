# TDSB Homework Management System

<!-- > _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical.  -->

## Description
<!--  * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?
 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem? -->
 Our application allows Toronto School Board District students to manage all of their school work and to use various tools aimed to improve their school performance.

Students can create 'tasks' which are added to their calendars; tasks can range from any simple chore, to assignments and exams. Creating such tasks allows students to easily see and manage all of their various workload. Tasks have deadlines and are conveniently inserted into their Google Calendar so that it is organized and easily accessible.

Students can also keep track of their performance in multiple ways. For one, they can keep track of all of their grades by inputting their assignment and exam results into the app. Students can also set weights to every assignment and exam and see their current average grade for any course. Most importantly, students can get truly useful insight about their performance by using the 'Graphing' tool of our app, which showcases their grades and tasks completion over time for a course, which is a great way to gauge how well they're keeping up with the material and whether they should adjust the amount of effort they should be putting into said course.

There are many problems this app is trying to solve. For one, there is a lack of planning features available in TDSB's current system as the current system doesn't allow students to view and plan their work in a comprehensive and exhaustive manner, which leaves gaps in the planning process and can hinder students' success. Additionally, students currently have no way to easily see their performance and evaluate themselves, which TDSB considers vital for its students. Lastly, TDSB's current system relies entirely on a third party, so TDSB would like to have their own platform for more flexibility and control over the system, effectively allowing them to tailor the system for their students.

    - `npm install` to install front-end dependencies
    - `npm run serve` to start the front-end on `http://localhost:8080/`
* Server
    - `cd server` to access the server folder

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase?
 * What effect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
 * Why did you or your partner make this choice? -->
We decided to apply an MIT license to our codebase, which would most likely not affect the development of our code, but it does allow anyone to use or contribute to the code, so maybe we will see some pull-requests on our repository!
