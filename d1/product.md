# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME
> _Note:_ This document is meant to evolve throughout the planning phase of your project.    
 > That is, it makes sense for you commit regularly to this file while working on the project (especially edits/additions/deletions to the _Highlights_ section).
 > Most importantly, it is a reflection of all the planning you work you've done in the first iteration.

## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.         
   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

#### Q4: How will you build it?

 * Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify any and all languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?
 * What is your testing strategy?

#### Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a *[user of the app]*, I want to *[do something in the app]* in order to *[accomplish some goal]*```
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them
 * The user stories should be written in Github and each one must have clear acceptance criteria

## Process Details



#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role. 
 * Roles should reflect the structure of your team and be appropriate for your project. Not necessarily one role to one team member.

List each team member and:
 * A description of their role(s) and responsibilities including the components they'll work on and non-software related work
 * 3 technical strengths and weaknesses each (e.g. languages, frameworks, libraries, development methodologies, etc.)

#### Team Rules

Describe your team's working culture.

Communications:
 * What is the expected frequency? What methods/channels are appropriate? 
 * If you have a partner project, what is your process (in detail) for communicating with your partner?
 
Meetings:

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc.

#### Partner Meetings
You must have at least 2 meetings with your project partner - an initial planning meeting and a document review meeting. Describe the meetings here:
* When and where?
* What did you discuss during the meeting (**note you must have meeting minutes**)?

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.
